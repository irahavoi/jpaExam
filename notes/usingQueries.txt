JPA supports two methods for expressing queries to retrieve entities and other persistent data from the database: query languages and the criteria API.
JP QL - Java persistence Query Language.
SELECT e FROM Employee e
Instead of selecting from a table, an entity from the application domain model has been specified instead.

SELECT e.name FROM Employee e  <--fetching a field 
SELECT e.department FROM Employee e <-- fetching a related entity

em.getReference() <-- will return the proxy of the asked entity containing info about the key only.

Relationship maintenance is the responsibility of the application. 
If the entity to be removed is the target of foreign keys in other tables, those foreign keys must be cleared
for the remove to succeed:

Employee emp = em.find(Employee.class, empId);
ParkingSpace ps = emp.getParkingSpace();
emp.setParkingSpace(null);
em.remove(ps);

Cascading Operations: JPA provides a mechanism to define when operations such as persist should be automatically cascaded across relationships.
The "cascade" attribute in all the logical relationship annotations(@OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, and @ManyToMany), defines the list of entity manager
operations to be cascaded:
	@ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
                             CascadeType.DETACH
                             CascadeType.MERGE
                             CascadeType.PERSIST
                             CascadeType.REFRESH
                             CascadeType.REMOVE

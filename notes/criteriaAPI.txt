Criteria API (p. 267 of 538)

CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Employee> c = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
c.select(emp)
.where(cb.equal(emp.get("name"), "John Smith"));

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Criteria API queries (272).
Creating a Query Definition:

EntityManager.getCriteriaBuilder()

3 methods for creating a query definition:

	CriteriaBuilder
		.createQuery(Class<T>)  <--The result is typed
		.createQuery()  <-- The result is object
		.createTupleQuery() <-- Returns Tuple, an object containing an assortment of objects and applies typing to 
					aggregate parts. It can be used whenever multiple items are returned and you want to combine 
					them into a single typed object.

JP QL Clause --> Criteria API --> Interface Method

SELECT -->  CriteriaQuery -->  select()
	    Subquery --> select()
FROM --> AbstractQuery --> from()
WHERE --> AbstractQuery --> where()
ORDER BY --> CriteriaQuery  --> orderBy()
GROUP BY --> AbstractQuery --> groupBy()
HAVING --> AbstractQuery --> having()
		
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Criteria Objects and Mutability (p. 274)
The majority of objects created through the criteria API are in fact immutable.

Only the CriteriaBuilder methods that create query definition objects produce truly mutable
results. The CriteriaQuery and Subquery objects are intended to be modified many times by invoking
methods such as select(), from(), and where(). But even here care must be taken as invoking methods
twice can have one of two different effects. In most cases, invoking a method twice replaces the contents
within the object with the argument being supplied. For example, invoking select() twice with two
different arguments results in only the argument from the second invocation actually remaining as part
of the query definition.
In some cases, however, invoking a method twice is in fact addition. Invoking from() twice with
different arguments results in multiple query roots being added to the query definition.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Query Roots and Path Expressions (275)

The AbstractQuery interface (parent of CriteriaQuery) provides the from() method to define the
abstract schema type that will form the basis for the query. This method accepts an entity type as a
parameter and adds a new root to the query.

CriteriaQuery<Employee> c = criteriaBuilder.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);

The Root interface
is itself extended from the From interface, which exposes functionality for joins. The From interface
extends Path, which further extends Expression and then Selection, allowing the root to be used in other
parts of the query definition.

Calls to the from() method are additive. Each call adds another root to the query, resulting in a Cartesian
product when more than one root is defined if no further constraints are applied in the WHERE clause.

Example with multiple roots:
SELECT DISTINCT d FROM Department d, Employee e WHERE d = e.department

Using criteria API, this query is constructed by calling from() twice:

CriteriaQuery<Department> c = cb.createQuery(Department.class);

Root<Department> dept = c.from(Department.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);

c.select(dept)
  .distinct(true)
  .where(cb.equal(dept, emp.get("department")));



PATH Expressions:

Consider the following basic JP QL query, which returns all the employees living in New York City:
SELECT e
FROM Employee e <-- Query root
WHERE e.address.city = 'New York' <--Path expression

To represent this path expression using the criteria API, we would use the following expression:
emp.get("address").get("city");

.get() method here is equivalent to the dot operator used in JP QL. It returns a Path object - which
allows this method to be chained together.

CriteriaQuery<Employee> c = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
c.select(emp)
  .where(cb.equal(emp.get("address").get("city"), "New York"));

Once again it is worth emphasizing that the from() method of
AbstractQuery should never be invoked more than once for each desired root. Invoking it multiple times
will result in additional roots being created and a Cartesian product if not careful. Always store the root
objects locally and refer to them when necessary.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SELECT CLAUSE (p. 277)

Selecting Single Expressions:

criteraQuery.select()

Some vendors may allow the call to select() to be omitted in the case where there is a single query
root and it matches the declared result type for the query. This is non-portable behavior.

criteriaQuery.distinct(true); <-- removes dubplicates


The type of the expression provided to the select() method must be compatible with the result type used to
create the CriteriaQuery object.

For example, if the CriteriaQuery object was created by invoking
createQuery(Project.class) on the CriteriaBuilder interface, then it will be an error to attempt to set
an expression resolving to the Employee entity using the select() method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting Multiple Expressions.

When defining a SELECT clause that involves more than one expression, the criteria API approach
required depends on how the query definition was created.

If the result type is Tuple, then a
CompoundSelection<Tuple> object must be passed to select().

If the result type is a non-persistent class
that will be created using a constructor expression, then the argument must be a
CompoundSelection<[T]> object, where [T] is the class type of the non-persistent class.

Finally, if the result type is an array of objects, then a CompoundSelection<Object[]> object must be provided. These
objects are created with the tuple(), construct() and array() methods of the CriteriaBuilder interface,
respectively.

CriteriaQuery<Tuple> c= cb.createTupleQuery();
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
c.select(cb.tuple(emp.get("id"), emp.get("name")));

.multiselect() <-- method of the CriteriaQuery interface. may be used to set
the SELECT clause. The multiselect() method will create the appropriate argument type given the
result type of the query.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using ALiases:
Like JP QL, aliases may be set on expressions in the SELECT clause, which will then be included in the resulting
sql.

Aliases are useful when the query has a result type of Tuple. 

CriteriaQuery<Tuple> c= cb.createTupleQuery();
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
c.multiselect(emp.get("id").alias("id"), emp.get("name").alias("fullName"));

Invoking alias() changes the original Selection object and returns it from
the method invocation. It is invalid to set the alias of a Selection object more than once.

Making use of the alias when iterating over the query results is as simple as requesting the
expression by name:

TypedQuery<Tuple> q = em.createQuery(c);
for (Tuple t : q.getResultList()) {
  String id = t.get("id", String.class);
  String fullName = t.get("fullName", String.class);
  // ...
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FROM Clause. (expressing joins using Criteria API)

Inner and outer Joins. - p.280
Join expressions are created using the join() method of the From interface, which is extended both by
Root, which we covered earlier, and Join, which is the object type returned by creating join expressions.
This means that any query root may join, and that joins may chain with one another. The join() method
requires a path expression argument and optionally an argument to specify the type of join,
JoinType.INNER or JoinType.LEFT, for inner and outer joins respectively.


Join<Employee,Project> project = emp.join("projects", JoinType.LEFT);

Had the JoinType.LEFT argument been omitted, the join type would have defaulted to be an inner join.

Joins may also be cascaded in a single statement. The resulting join will be typed by the source and
target of the last join in the statement:
Join<Employee,Project> project = dept.join("employees").join("projects");

Joins across collection relationships that use Map are a special case. JP QL uses the KEY and VALUE
keywords to extract the key or value of a Map element for use in other parts of the query. In the criteria
API, these operators are handled by the key() and value() methods of the MapJoin interface.

Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
MapJoin<Employee,String,Phone> phone = emp.joinMap("phones");

joinCollection()
joinSet()
joinList()


One can also use strongly-typed version of join().

As with JP QL, the criteria API supports the fetch join, a query construct that allows data to be prefetched
into the persistence context as a side effect of a query that returns a different, but related, entity.

The criteria API builds fetch joins through the use of the fetch() method on the FetchParent interface. It is
used instead of join() in cases where fetch semantics are required and accepts the same argument
types.

CriteriaQuery<Employee> c = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
emp.fetch("address");   <-- The return type is Fetch.  Fetch cannot be used anywhere else in the query.
c.select(emp);

Use JoinType.LEFT if you do not want to skip employees that have no address:
emp.fetch("address", JoinType.LEFT);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The WHERE clause (282):

AbstractQuery.where()

Each call to where() will render any previously set WHERE expressions 
to be discarded and replaced with the newly passed-in ones.

SOME 			some()
- 			neg(), diff()
+ 			sum()
* 			prod()

ABS 			abs()
CONCAT 			concat()
CURRENT_DATE 		currentDate()
CURRENT_TIME 		currentTime()

AVG 			avg()
SUM 			sum(), sumAsLong(), sumAsDouble()
MIN 			min(), least()
MAX 			max(), greatest()
COUNT 			count()
COUNT DISTINCT 		countDistinct()
---------------------------------------------------




Predicates (285):

there are two sets of methods available for relative comparisons. For example, there is greaterThan() and gt(). The twoletter
forms are specific to numeric values and are strongly typed to work with number types. The long forms must be used for all other cases.


Parameters:
CriteriaQuery<Employee> c = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
c.select(emp);
ParameterExpression<String> deptName =
cb.parameter(String.class, "deptName");
c.where(cb.equal(emp.get("dept").get("name"), deptName));



Subqueries:
The AbstractQuery interface provides the subquery() method for creation of subqueries.

The argument to subquery() is a class instance
representing the result type of the subquery. The return value is an instance of Subquery, which is itself
an extension of AbstractQuery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN Expressions (289):

SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.address.state IN ('NY', 'CA')

converting the above JP QL using Criteria API:

CriteriaQuery<Employee> c = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
c.select(emp).where(cb.in(emp.get("address").get("state")).value("NY").value("CA"));

or using in():

c.select(emp).where(emp.get("address").get("state").in("NY","CA"));

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE  Expressions: 
Case expressions are required by JPA providers but may not be supported by all databases.
The use of the case statement on the database not supporting them is undefined.

SELECT p.name,
  CASE WHEN TYPE(p) = DesignProject THEN 'Development'
       WHEN TYPE(p) = QualityProject THEN 'QA'
       ELSE 'Non-Development'
  END
  FROM Project p
WHERE p.employees IS NOT EMPTY

The selectCase() method of the CriteriaBuilder interface is used to create the CASE expression.

CriteriaQuery<Object[]> c = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Project> project = c.from(Project.class);
c.multiselect(project.get("name"),cb.selectCase()
	.when(cb.equal(project.type(), DesignProject.class),"Development")
	.when(cb.equal(project.type(), QualityProject.class),"QA")
	.otherwise("Non-Development"))
  .where(cb.isNotEmpty(project.<List<Employee>>get("employees")));

The when() and otherwise() methods correspond to the WHEN and ELSE keywords from JP QL.
Unfortunately, “else” is already a keyword in Java so “otherwise” must be used as a substitute.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COALESCE (p.291):

CriteriaQuery<Object> c = cb.createQuery();
Root<Department> dept = c.from(Department.class);
c.select(cb.coalesce()
  .value(dept.get("name"))
  .value(dept.get("id")));

Or one can use convenience method and pass values right in coalesce method:

c.select(cb.coalesce(dept.get("name"), dept.get("id")));

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function Expressions (p 292):
Function expressions are a feature unique to the
criteria API that allows native SQL stored functions to be mixed with other criteria API expressions
They are intended for cases where a limited amount of native SQL is required to satisfy some requirement but
you don’t want to convert the entire query to SQL

Functions are created using CriteriaBuilder.function()

It requires as arguments the database function name, the expected return type and a variable list of
arguments, if any, that should be passed to the function. The return type is an Expression, so it can be
used in many other places within the query.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORDER BY Clause (292)

CriteriaQuery.orderBy()

accepts one or more Order objects, which are created by the asc() and desc() methods of the
CriteriaBuilder interface:

CriteriaQuery<Tuple> c = cb.createQuery(Tuple.class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);

Join<Employee,Department> dept = emp.join("dept");
c.multiselect(dept.get("name"), emp.get("name"));

c.orderBy(cb.desc(dept.get("name")),
	  cb.asc(emp.get("name")));

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses


CriteriaQuery<Object[]> c = cb.createQuery(Object[].class);
Root<Employee> emp = c.from(Employee.class);
Join<Employee,Project> project = emp.join("projects");

c.multiselect(emp, cb.count(project))
  .groupBy(emp)
  .having(cb.ge(cb.count(project),2));				

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strongly Typed query definitions (293)

Metamodel:
  EntityManager.getMetamodel()

To get information about the entity:

Metamodel mm = em.getMetamodel();
EntityType<EMployee> emp_ = mm.entity(Employee.class);

Equivalent methods for embeddables and manged types:
	.embeddable()
	.managedType()

if there is no such entity in persistence context, IllegalArgument exception is thrown.

Advanced Object-Relational Mapping (301)
----------------------------------------------------------
Table and Column Names:

@Table(name="employee")
@Table(name="Employee")
@Table(name="EMPLOYEE")

Some database names are intended to be case-specific, and must be explicitly delimited.
While it is by no means common, or good practice, a database in theory could have an EMPLOYEE table as well as an Employee table.

The method of
delimiting is the use of a second set of double quotes, which must be escaped, around the identifier. The
escaping mechanism is the backslash (the “\” character), which would cause the following annotations
to refer to different tables:
@Table(name="\"Employee\"")
@Table(name="\"EMPLOYEE\"")

When in XML file:
<column name="&quot;ID&quot;"/>
<column name="&quot;Id&quot;"/>

By including the empty delimited-identifiers element in the XML mapping file, all identifiers in
the persistence unit will be treated as delimited, and quotes will be added to them when they are passed
to the driver.
